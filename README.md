## Overview

The goal of this project is to create an automated system that extracts information from videos (and images) for the purpose of creating a queryable database of information and aggregating statistics to use for analysis.

This repository is very much a work in progress, but feel free to look around.

## TODOs

* break scripts into subfolders based on which part of the pipeline they belong to (data set creation, BOVW creation, model training/testing)

* develop Readmes for each part of the pipeline with examples
